# On Soft Clustering for Correlation Estimators: Model Uncertainty, Differentiability, and Surrogates

## Overview 

The repository contains all material that went into the ***American Astronomical Society Winter Session*** abstract, ***On Differentiable Correlation Functions*** by [Edward Berman](https://ebrmn.space/) and [Jacqueline McCleary](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jacqueline-mccleary/). 

An expanded version of that work is currently in preparation for submission to the ***Open Journal of Astrophysics*** with the title ***On Soft Clustering for Correlation Estimators: Model Uncertainty, Differentiability, and Surrogates*** by [Edward Berman](https://ebrmn.space/), [Sneh Pandya](https://snehjp2.github.io/), [Jacqueline McCleary](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jacqueline-mccleary/), Marko Shuntov, Caitlin Casey, Nicole Drakos, Andreas Faisst, Steven Gillman, Ghassem Gozaliasl, Natalie Hogg, Jeyhan Kartaltepe, Anton Koekemoer, Wilfried Mercier, Diana Scognamiglio, and COSMOS-Web: The JWST Cosmic Origins Survey.

A short summary of this work is available [here](https://cosmo-corr.netlify.app/)
