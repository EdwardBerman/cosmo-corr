# On Soft Clustering for Correlation Estimators: Model Uncertainty, Differentiability, and Surrogates

![image](assets/process.png)

The repository contains all material that went into the ***American Astronomical Society Winter Session*** abstract, ***On Differentiable Correlation Functions*** by Edward Berman and Jacqueline McCleary. 

An expanded version of that work is currently in preparation for submission to the ***Open Journal of Astrophysics*** with the title ***On Soft Clustering for Correlation Estimators: Model Uncertainty, Differentiability, and Surrogates***.

Docs and project details will be made available [here](https://cosmo-corr.netlify.app/)
